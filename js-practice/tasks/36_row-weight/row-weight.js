// ### Row Weight

// Several people are standing in a row divided into two teams.
// The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1, and so on.

// Given an array of positive integers (the weights of the people), return a new array of two integers, where the first one is the total weight of team 1, and the second one is the total weight of team 2.
